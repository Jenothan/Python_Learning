# Python\_Learning

loop, if condition, list, dict, relational operators



This repo is about my python basic learning. I just try to practice and understand small things like list, dictionary, loops, if conditions and relational operators. Not very professional code but more for me to learn step by step. Some codes may look simple but that is how I remember better. I keep this like a note for me so later I can see again. If anyone find mistake also its ok, this is just my learning journey
